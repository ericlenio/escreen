    # re-issue the same ssh command. Deemed a small enough risk to be

    # 1) ssh to host and find a known open port: at the expense of 2 separate
    # ssh connections
    #
    # 2) run a ControlMaster, and then a separate ssh command to find the port:
    # good with modern ssh's, but various issues with older ssh (like 4.7 on
    # Ubuntu Hardy)
    #
    # 3) After connecting to remote ssh host, find open port, then run GNU
    # screen escape to run ssh escape command (ESC ] 83 ; cmd ^G) to forward
    # the port: this leads to terminal IO issues when stuffing the ssh escape
    # command into the terminal driver.

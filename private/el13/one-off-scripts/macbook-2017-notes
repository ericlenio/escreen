Notes on Macbook Retina, 12 inch, 2017

=Graphics

Intel HD Graphics 615: supports H.265/HEVC Main10 profile in hardware with 10
bit colors. Furthermore, Googles VP9 codec can also be hardware decoded. The
first models do not support HDCP 2.2 and therefore Netflix 4K. This was added
with the new models in 2017 and beginning of May 2017 also the older CPU models
like the m3-7Y30 are now shipped with a new S-Spec Code that supports HDCP 2.2.
HDMI 2.0 however is still only supported with an external converter chip
(LSPCon).
